# cookbox
An open-source cook book created by all of you.

### Instructions on how to submit are coming soon. 
For now, the general idea is to create a pull request with a new recipe (copied from `recipes/template-with-salsa.html`). 
- Please use hyphens in the file name to represent spaces
- The file name should be close to the title of the recipe. 
- All images can be hosted either on imgur, or in the images directory. 
- Please do not change html outside of the content div, you are free to put stuff inside the content div but please follow the general structure that is given. 
- You can include JS but only if it adds to the article and isn't bloat. The chances of me accepting javascript is 1 in 30 so don't bother if it isn't essential.
- You can include CSS but only if it adds to the article and isn't bloat. The chances of me accepting CSS is 1 in 10 so try to avoid it.
- Stick to the listed image resolutions until I remove this line.

If this blows up I'll buy a domain. For now, enjoy the long github pages link.
