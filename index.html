  <h1>Welcome to Cookbox.</h1>
  <p>Cookbox hosts recipes in the public domain. If you would like to submit a recipe then please leave a pull request in the <a href="https://github.com/input-variable/cookbox">github repo</a>.</p><p>
  If you would like to see recipes then you can press that niftly little link on the top right. Next to that is the lightswitch. It creates a small cookie in your browser so you don't have to toggle it every time you load a new page.

  Lastly, I would like to apologise for my messy code. I wrote this in a couple of hours after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY70NCW98Is">a video</a> that gave me this idea. If this gains traction I will rewrite 90% of this. I'll be looking for maintainers to help accept pull requests soon. This site was made by <a href="https://github.com/input-variable">nakotami.</a>
